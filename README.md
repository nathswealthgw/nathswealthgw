## About Me

I’m a senior AI/ML Engineer with over a decade of experience building complex projects like [MultiChain Fraud Intelligence system](https://github.com/nathswealthgw/blockchain-fraud-detection), designing, deploying, and scaling high-performance machine learning systems across fintech, SaaS, and decentralized infrastructure environments.

I specialize in translating research-grade AI into production-grade systems that operate reliably at scale.

Throughout my career, I have:

- Secured **1M+ blockchain transactions** using AI anomaly detection  
- Deployed federated learning systems across **100+ distributed nodes**  
- Supported **10,000+ daily API requests** in latency-sensitive trading systems  
- Reduced inference latency to **<100ms in production environments**  
- Built ML pipelines powering **120K+ IoT devices**

### Fun Fact: I build resilient, world-class, production-grade systems as a hobby. That's why some call me “The Software Lord.”👑

## System Design Philosophy

At Staff level, I focus on:

**Scalability First**  
Architect systems that scale from MVP to enterprise without redesign.

**Reliability & Observability**  
Production ML must be monitored, explainable, and fault-tolerant.

**Research → Production Translation**  
Bridging experimental models and maintainable, long-lived systems.

**Latency Awareness**  
Engineering inference pipelines optimized for real-time workloads.

**Privacy by Design**  
Federated learning and decentralized AI strategies where appropriate.
